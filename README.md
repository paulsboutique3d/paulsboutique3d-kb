# Paul's Boutique 3D — Build guides for Cults3D filesets

This repository contains print and assembly documentation for Paul's Boutique 3D filesets listed on Cults3D. It does not host STL files and does not cover unrelated products or services.

## Get the 3D models

- All STL files are available on Cults3D: https://cults3d.com/en/users/PaulsBoutique3D/3d-models
- This repo only provides the accompanying build guides, BOMs, and print notes.

## How to use this repo

1) Pick your project below and open its folder.
2) Read the print notes and BOM (if provided).
3) Follow the assembly steps in order.

## Project guides

- [M41A Pulse Rifle](m41a/)
	- Assembly, electronics install, paint notes, and BOM listing.
- [M41A MK2 Pulse Rifle](m41a-mk2/)
- [M41A/2 Pulse Rifle](m41a-2/)
- [M314 Motion Tracker](m314/)
- [M240 Incinerator Unit](m240/)
- [F44AA](f44aa/)
- [Lacrima99](lacrima99/)
- [Ace of Spades Hand Cannon](ace-of-spades-hand-cannon/)

Each folder contains one or more markdown files with step-by-step assembly. Where applicable, a BOM file is included (for example, `m41a/bom-listing.md`, `f44aa/f44aa-bom.md`).

## Printing basics

- Material: PLA+ or PETG are recommended unless a guide specifies otherwise.
- Layer height: ~0.20 mm for general parts; use finer layers for cosmetic surfaces if desired.
- Walls/perimeters: 3–4; infill: 20–35% (per part requirements).
- Supports: only where a guide indicates; orient parts as shown in the guide images.
- Tolerances: print a small test piece if you’re unsure; light sanding may be required on mating features.
- Adhesives/fasteners: use CA or epoxy as noted; fastener sizes are listed in the project BOMs.

## License and scope

- This documentation is provided for personal builds of the corresponding Cults3D filesets.
- STL files are not included here; download them from Cults3D.
- Do not redistribute the models or documentation outside the terms of the Cults3D license.
