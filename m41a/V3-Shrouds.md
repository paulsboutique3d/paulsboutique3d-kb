The V3 Shrouds have been redesigned to fit Airsoft M41A's and Airsoft metal mags. They also match SD Studios mag bases. 
They print in 3 pieces and are glued together. I have recessed the lugs to make alignemet easier also.
The rear clip is now one piece and the mag well tabs are removable and held on with 2 x m3 4mm bolts.
