When i designed the original cad files for the Thompson, i was a bit obsessed in reproducing everything exactly as it was. <br/>
Unfortunatley 3D printing does not always print parts well that were designed to be stamped in metal etc. After many many feedback messages and version changes, I have a much simpler trigger assembly for the Thompson.<br/>

### This is for a static build, no electronics.
This trigger will fit: <br/>
Version 2 Thompson lower frames <br/> 
Version 3 Thompson lower frames. <br/> 
All that is needed for the BOM is 2 springs approx 0.6mm thickness and a max diameter of 8mm, length no more than 20mm (you can cut to get your trigger stiffness) <br/>
