## Version 2 Electronics for Shroud (V2)

- Original geometry and profile.  
- **Narrower shroud**; not designed for airsoft magazines.  
- Works with my existing V2 build.  
- Great if you’re matching older builds.

---

## Version 3 Electronics for Shroud (V3)

- **Wider shroud**—accepts **airsoft magazines** natively.  
- Updated clearances and interfaces for easier assembly and alignment.  
- Compatible with common aftermarket parts (e.g., SD Studios mag base)  
- Recommended for new builds, especially if you want airsoft mag compatibility out of the box.
